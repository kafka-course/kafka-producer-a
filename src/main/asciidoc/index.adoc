# First Attempt of sending an event



## What this example project shows

* set up a two broker kafka cluster with docker-compose
* send messages, ignoring any response from the Producer-API

## Let it run

### Setup Infrastructure
``
docker-compose up -d
``
### Run the example programm
``
./mvnw spring-boot:run
``
### Check that message has been send:

[Web UI (http://localhost:9000)](http://localhost:9000)
(When you are having problems starting the Web UI container, you likely have to change file permissions:
``sudo chown -R 5050:5050 volumes/pg-admin-data/``)
### Stop the infrastructure

``
docker-compose down
``
